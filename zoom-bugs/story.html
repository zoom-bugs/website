<p>Zoom Bugs are a sort of bug that only affects people when the instructor asks them a question and they become stuck for whatever reason (either mentally or physically). [name] created this word. This is something that a lot of people do all over the world. These small creatures, dubbed "zoom bugs", pose a serious danger to a student's learning progress.</p>

<p>The First Reported Case:</p>
<p>
The first reported case of a bug like “Zoom bug” was in early 2020, orginally reported by Yusuf Salahuddin this alpha version of zoom bug affected a student of Abu Dhabi Indian School (A.D.I.S) named “[ogname]”, reportedly if the word ‘[ogname]’ was called the student [ogname] would be out of the class and not be back until the next period. He was so scared of his own name that he would leave even if he was being called for attendance. The zoom bugs were soon found to be contagious as it soon spread to other students of the same class.
</p>
<p>
The students of the class would occasionally warn the teacher about the upcoming consequences of asking him a question and the teachers avoided asking him questions thinking it is better if he doesn't answer but still listens to the class.
</p>
<p>
The Second Reported Case:
</p>
<p>
The contagious zoom bugs soon found its way to another student in A.D.I.S - Wijdan Anwar (Wijdan). Granted he did have some real problems.
</p>
<p>
The problem started when he traveled to india in late 2020, after his parents reported that his internet would be slow and the teacher excusing him out of class a handful of times  it started to go into his head he often answer questions that were asked to him with a little lag but a question that he doesn't know the answer to and he is either stuck physically or he fumbles up some words in an attempt to delay the answer to give him enough time disconnect his internet to give the illusion to have a bad internet connection. 
</p>
<p>
But unlike [ogname] who never responded, this was not always the case with Wijdan, in breakout rooms while with his friends, he could speak with no disruption at all; he would talk normally and interact as if he was having the best internet connection in the world.
</p>
<p>
The followers:
</p>
<p>
After the case of [ogname] many people took inspiration and aspired to be equally if not better than him at annoying teachers. It is to be noted that these minds, if put to good use could change the world but they did not. Strangely, these bugs seemed to update whenever they were used. The strange fact is that it will only happen when maam asks them a question and they will play hide and seek in online classes.

<p>
A true pioneer and a visionary in zoom bugs and by the time it had affected him the “ZOOM BUGS “ virus had reached its beta stage (by the help of [ogname]) this stage caused people not to respond at all when mentioned in class he was not afraid of even higher forces such as the middle school boys supervisor (he/she who is superly wise and supervises middle school boys) as reported by our hindi language teacher  (2021 - 2022).

A hard working and seed sower in the development of the art of annoying he like many people was a part of A.D.I.S long before the villain fired the first dose of coronavirus (I mean covid19 since SARS and MERS are also considered coronaviruses) although not the best in the class he has answered the questions posed to him BCE (before covid era)
