                    The contagious zoom bugs soon found its way to another student in [sname] - [name] ([shname]). Granted he did have <b>some</b> real problems.

                    The problem started when he traveled to india in late 2020, after his parents reported that his internet would be slow and the teacher excusing him out of class a handful of times  it started to go into his head he often answer questions that were asked to him with a little lag but a question that he doesn't know the answer to and he is either stuck physically or he fumbles up some words in an attempt to delay the answer to give him enough time disconnect his internet to give the illusion to have a bad internet connection. 
                    
                    But unlike [ogname] who never responded, this was not always the case with [name], in breakout rooms while with his friends, he could speak with no disruption at all; he would talk normally and interact as if he was having the best internet connection in the world.
