                    The followers:

                    After the case of [ogname] many people took inspiration and aspired to be equally if not better than him at annoying teachers. It is to be noted that these minds, if put to good use could change the world but they did not. Strangely, these bugs seemed to update whenever they were used. The strange fact is that it will only happen when maam asks them a question and they will play hide and seek in online classes.

                    [name1]

                    A true pioneer and a visionary in zoom bugs and by the time it had affected him the “ZOOM BUGS “ virus had reached its beta stage (by the help of [ogname]) this stage caused people not to respond at all when mentioned in class he was not afraid of even higher forces such as the middle school boys supervisor (he/she who is superly wise and supervises middle school boys) as reported by our hindi language teacher  (2021 - 2022).

                    [name2]
 
                    A hard working and seed sower in the development of the art of annoying he like many people was a part of [sname] long before the villain fired the first dose of coronavirus (I mean covid19 since SARS and MERS are also considered coronaviruses) although not the best in the class he has answered the questions posed to him BCE (before covid era)
