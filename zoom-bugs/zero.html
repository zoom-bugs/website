                <h5>The first reported case of a bug like “Zoom bug” was in early 2020, orginally reported by [name] this alpha version of zoom bug affected a student of [sname] [(sname)] named [name], reportedly if the word [name] was called the student [ogname] would be out of the class and not be back until the next period. He was so scared of his own name that he would leave even if he was being called for attendance. The zoom bugs were soon found to be contagious as it soon spread to other students of the same class.

                The students of the class would occasionally warn the teacher about the upcoming consequences of asking him a question and the teachers avoided asking him questions thinking it is better if he doesn't answer but still listens to the class.
